#Key generation

#Goal, be able to output a public key (G^,t)  and private keys G,P,S



# create a generating matrix G of size n by m that decodable with t errors

def generatingMatrix():
    pass
    #return G , t

# create an inveritble  matrix S of size m by m

def invertibleMatrix():

    #return S
    pass


#  create a permutation matrix P of size n by n

def permMatrix():

    #return P
    pass


# put the tree parts together

def generate_keys(): ##should we we able to input the size of the matrix you want????

    #return G^, G, P, S, t
    pass
